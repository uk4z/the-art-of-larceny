Mr. K,

Your objective is to infiltrate a secluded mansion, known for its connections to the clandestine world of high finance. Within its heavily guarded walls lies a computer that holds a portion of a vast fortune amassed by a notorious criminal organization.

It has come to our attention that this portion of their fortune has been deliberately divided into three distinct currencies. This strategic division serves a dual purpose: to safeguard their illicit wealth and to create an intricate system of financial complexity that conceals the true extent of their resources.

By fragmenting their fortune across multiple currencies, The [name] aims to mitigate the risk of a single theft compromising their entire wealth. Furthermore, this division serves as a smokescreen, making it more challenging for authorities and rival organizations to grasp the magnitude of their financial influence.

Your mission is twofold: to hack into the mansion's computer and access the encrypted data that reveals the exchange rates between these three currencies, and then to make a shrewd decision based on your analysis. Your choice of currency will determine the portion of their fortune that we can seize, disrupt their operations, and undermine their criminal empire.


Remember, Mr. K, our mission extends beyond personal gain. By striking at the heart of their financial power and exploiting their divisions, we can weaken The [name]'s grip on society and pave the way for justice and restoration.

We have complete faith in your abilities, and our organization stands fully behind you, providing the necessary support and resources for your mission. 

Seize this opportunity, Mr. K, and let your ambition shine as you navigate the treacherous path towards dismantling the [name]'s financial stronghold.
